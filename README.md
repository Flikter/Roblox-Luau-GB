# Roblox Luau GB

This is a fork of [LuaGB](https://github.com/zeta0134/LuaGB) (by [zeta0134](https://github.com/zeta0134/)) ported to work in Roblox's new EditableImage feature! Currently it contains a Roblox plugin frontend since the beta feature is only available in Roblox Studio. It functions as a rojo project.

At present this is a barebones port only supports the display and inputs. I still need to implement saving/loading and audio. Be sure to check out the original project to see all of the supported features of this emulator!

No ROM files are provided, you'll have to find out how to legally obtain those yourself.
